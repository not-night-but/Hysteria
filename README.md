# Hysteria
Just a project I'm working on in my free time (mostly just on weekends and some nights). My is goal just to make a git client that I like using that is cross platform (lazygit is fantastic but I don't always want to be in the terminal for everything I do with git).

I'd also like to have closer integration with GitHub (viewing repository issues, pull requests, collaborators, etc.)

This is currently being developed with Rust, Tauri, Vue, Typescript, and SCSS
